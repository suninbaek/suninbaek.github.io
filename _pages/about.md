Welcome! I am an undergraduate researcher at Korea University, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, alongside an interdisciplinary major in Medical Convergence Engineering, offered through the KU-KIST Graduate School. I am part of the [Movement Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.daekyumkim.com/home), where I am advised by Prof. [Daekyum Kim](https://www.daekyumkim.com/members/professor). 

My research focuses on multimodal human state analysis through the integration of diverse sensor data, with applications in exoskeleton control and human-robot interaction. By utilizing data from various sensors such as  IMUs, biosensors, pressure sensors, and computer vision systems, I aim to develop robust models that enhance the understanding of human biomechanics and optimize the performance of wearable robots. 

I am particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning and robotics, and how these fields can converge to improve the adaptability and efficiency of exoskeletons. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of exoskeletons that can seamlessly interact with and augment human capabilities, enhancing quality of life for individuals in their daily lives.

I expect to graduate in February 2025 and plan to continue my academic journey into graduate school within the same lab, focusing on preference learning-based exoskeleton control to further personalize and improve wearable robot functionality. Feel free to explore my work and reach out for potential collaborations!
