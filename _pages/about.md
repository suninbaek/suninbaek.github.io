## About
Welcome! I am a first-year M.S. student in the [Movement Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.daekyumkim.com/home), advised by [Prof. Daekyum Kim](https://www.daekyumkim.com/members/professor) at Korea University. Previously, I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a B.S. in Medical Convergence Engineering from Korea University in 2025. 

My research focuses on developing **preference-based control framework for ankle exoskeletons** using real-time physiological data, such as heart rate variability (HRV), to dynamically adjust torque during walking. This approach aims to enable the exoskeleton to adapt to varying gait speeds, terrains, and individual needs, enhancing comfort, reducing metabolic costs, and delivering a personalized mobility experience.

In parallel, I investigate multimodal human state analysis by integrating data from IMUs, physiological sensors, and computer vision systems. By leveraging robust machine learning models, I aim to deepen our understanding of human biomechanics and optimize exoskeleton performance, leading to more intuitive and adaptive control strategies for wearable robots.

My long-term goal is to develop exoskeletons that seamlessly interact with and augment human capabilities, ultimately empowering individuals with enhanced mobility and autonomy in daily life.

Please feel free to explore my work and reach out for potential collaborations! (**[CV](https://suninbaek.github.io/cv/)**)
